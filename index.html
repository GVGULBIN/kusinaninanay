            <div class="product__subtitle product__subtitle--expanded" style="--delay: 0.4s">healthy Benefits </br>

                * Rich in carbohydrates: Pancit is a great source of carbohydrates, which provide energy to the body. The noodles used in Pancit are usually made from rice or wheat 
                flour, which are high in complex carbohydrates and provide a slow release of energy.</br>

                * High in protein: Pancit often includes protein-rich ingredients such as meat, chicken, seafood, and vegetables. Protein is essential for building and repairing 
                tissues in the body and helps to keep the immune system strong.</br>

                * Contains fiber: Vegetables such as carrots, cabbage, and bean sprouts are commonly used in Pancit, and these are high in fiber. Fiber is important for maintaining 
                good digestive health, as it helps to regulate bowel movements and prevent constipation.</br>

                * Low in fat: Pancit is generally a low-fat dish, as it is typically stir-fried or boiled with minimal oil. This makes it a healthy option for those looking to 
                maintain a healthy weight or reduce their fat intake. </br>

                * Packed with vitamins and minerals: The vegetables used in Pancit are rich in vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C, vitamin A, iron, and potassium, which are 
                important for overall health and well-being. </br>

            
            </div>
            <div class="product__subtitle product__subtitle--expanded" style="--delay: 0.5s">The word "pancit" comes from the Hokkien term "pian e sit," which means "something 
                conveniently cooked." The dish was brought to the Philippines by Chinese traders and immigrants, who introduced the use of stir-frying and noodles to the local 
                cuisine.

                healthy Benefits </br>
                * Good source of protein: Pork is a rich source of protein, which is important for building and repairing tissues in the body. Protein also helps to keep you feeling 
                full for longer, which can be helpful for weight management.</br>
                * May lower blood pressure: Some studies suggest that the vinegar used in Pork Adobo may help to lower blood pressure. This is because vinegar contains acetic acid, 
                which can help to reduce the levels of certain enzymes that raise blood pressure.</br>
                * Contains antioxidants: Garlic, one of the main ingredients in Pork Adobo, is a good source of antioxidants, which can help to protect the body against damage from 
                free radicals and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</br>
                * May boost immunity: Garlic and black pepper, both commonly used in Pork Adobo, are believed to have immune-boosting properties. This can help to protect the body 
                against infections and illnesses.</br>
                * May improve digestion: Some of the ingredients in Pork Adobo, such as garlic, onion, and bay leaf, have been traditionally used to aid digestion and alleviate 
                digestive issues.</br>
            </div>
            <div class="product__subtitle product__subtitle--expanded" style="--delay: 0.5s">Pork Adobo is a traditional Filipino dish that has been around for centuries. The word
                "adobo" comes from the Spanish word "adobar," which means to marinate or sauce. The dish was originally a way of preserving meat in the tropical climate of the 
                Philippines before the advent of refrigeration.

                healthy Benefits </br>
                * Protein: Chicken is a good source of protein, which is essential for building and repairing tissues, supporting immune function, and maintaining healthy 
                skin, hair, and nails.</br>
                * Healthy Fats: Coconut milk is often used in chicken curry, which contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), a type of healthy fat that may help boost 
                metabolism and aid in weight loss.</br>
                * Anti-inflammatory Properties: Many of the spices used in chicken curry, such as turmeric, cumin, and coriander, have anti-inflammatory properties that 
                may help reduce inflammation in the body and improve overall health.</br>
                * Vitamins and Minerals: Chicken curry is often made with a variety of vegetables, such as onions, bell peppers, and spinach, which provide essential 
                vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C, potassium, and fiber.</br>
                * Heart Health: Some studies suggest that the spices used in chicken curry, such as turmeric, may help improve heart health by reducing inflammation and improving blood flow.</br>
            </div>
            <div class="product__subtitle product__subtitle--expanded" style="--delay: 0.5s">However, it is important to note that some chicken curry recipes can be high in fat and 
                calories, particularly if made with coconut milk and served with rice or naan bread. To make a healthier chicken curry, use lean chicken breast, low-fat yogurt, and 
                plenty of vegetables. You can also reduce the amount of coconut milk used or use a light version to cut back on calories.

                calories or unhealthy fats.

            <div class="product__subtitle product__subtitle--expanded" style="--delay: 0.5s">However, it is important to note that an omelette can be high in calories and fat, 
                depending on the ingredients and cooking method used. To make a healthier eggplant omelette, use a non-stick pan and cook with minimal oil or butter. You can also 
                add plenty of vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, and spinach, to boost the nutritional value and flavor of the dish. Additionally, using egg whites or a 
                combination of whole eggs and egg whites can reduce the calorie and fat content of the omelette.
